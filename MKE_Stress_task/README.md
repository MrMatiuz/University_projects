# FEM Stress Task

Computing workshop at the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics of Lomonosov Moscow State University
Here is set of functions for solving problems of linear elasticity by the finite element method (MKE / FEM).

It includes:
1. Implementation of functions for storing information about the grid-splitting the area into finite elements;
2. Implementation of the functions of interpolation of functions on the grid by its values in the nodes;
3. Implementation of static calculations and modal analysis in the formulation of the problem for linear elasticity.

Result you can see at the end of the file MKE_task.ipynb.
